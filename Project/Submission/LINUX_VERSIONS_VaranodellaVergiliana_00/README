Please see the README file in the ../MAC_VERSIONS subdirectory for more
detail. Compared to the files in the ../MAC_VERSIONS subdirectory, the
differences for the code in this directory are:

libassimp.so.3.1.1 - assimp was compiled as a shared library (or shared
	object). The setup-once file is therefore different.

Makefile - this file has to be different, of course.

vStart.glsl and fStart.glsl - Unlike the lab exercises, the project
	requires using the OpenGL 'menus' widget. To get the 
	scene-start program to work in the lab PCs (for Linux),
	the two shader files have to be the same as those for the Mac.

setup - instead of setting up the environment variable DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH,
	we set up the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH instead.
	However, ou might not need to set up this environment variable.

setup-once - similar to the setup-once in the ../MAC_VERSIONS subdirectory.
	However, since in the system directory /usr/lib64, there is
	no file with the name libGLEW.so, I have added a command to
	create a symbolic link to this shared library.

scene-start.cpp - if you use your own laptop or desktop to do the project,
	you may need to experiment a little bit to see if you need to
	uncomment the following lines:

		glutInitContextVersion( 3, 2);
		glutInitContextProfile( GLUT_CORE_PROFILE );
 
	in the main() function. On the Mac, these lines are not needed. 
	I found that these lines are not needed on the Linux platform
	in the CSSE Lab either.

	You do need the line
		glewInit();
	on Linux.
